### 📊 Data Source 📊

In our analysis, we have used flight delay data from the Aviyair API, which is available through subscription. This API has provided us with historical data, allowing us to analyze dense flight delay data from August 31 - September 9, 2023. The data contains more than xxx flights from a wide range of airports, including xxx, and airlines, including xxx.

It must be recognized here that while there is much information readily available on the internet regarding current delays on flights, it is very hard to find organized historical flight data, which we need to conduct out analysis. In our data sourcing process, we have tried and failed to find a proper data source many times before suceeding with the Aviyair API. We have tried collecting data through many APIs, the most extensive ones being the Aviationstack API and the Airlabs API. While some APIs have allowed us to collect insufficient (either due to information or volume), some we have not been able to access since many are only available through a paid subscription. xxxxx.....  Our data has allowed us to bring this together and present our findings coherently. 

### 🖇 Data Collection 🖇

We have collected data from xx airports in the xxx timeframe. This will allow us to make an accurate prediction regarding xxx.
